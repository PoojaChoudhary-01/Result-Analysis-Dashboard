👩‍💻 STUDENT NAME: POOJA CHOUDHARY
📅 PROJECT TITLE: Student Result Analysis using Power BI
📁 DATASET USED: Result.xlsx
📊 TOOL USED: Microsoft Power BI
------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
To analyze student performance across five subjects using Power BI by creating interactive visuals like cards, charts, and tables to identify top performers, failing students, grade distribution, and subject-wise performance.

------------------------------------------------------------

🔄 DATA TRANSFORMATION (POWER QUERY):

1. 📛 Renamed Columns:
   - Changed subject names to: Math Score, Science Score, History Score, Computer Science Score, English Score.

2. 🔢 Data Type Conversion:
   - Score columns → Whole Number
   - Name, Grade, Result → Text
   - Percentage → Decimal

3. ➕ Added Columns:
   a. Total Marks = Sum of all 5 subject scores
   b. Percentage = (Total Marks / 500) * 100
   c. Grade: Based on percentage
   d. Result: "Pass" if all subjects ≥ 35, else "Fail"
   e. FailedSubject: Count of subjects where score < 35

4. 🔄 Unpivoted Columns:
   - Unpivoted subject columns to create "Attribute" and "Value" for subject-wise analysis

5. 📉 Sorted & Cleaned:
   - Sorted percentage in descending order for top students
   - Removed unnecessary columns

------------------------------------------------------------

📊 VISUALS USED IN THE DASHBOARD:

1. 🟪 Card: Total Number of Students
2. 🟩 Card: Average Class Percentage
3. 🔵 Donut Chart: Pass vs Fail Distribution
4. 🟠 Donut Chart: Grade-wise Student Distribution
5. 🟨 Table: Top 5 Performing Students
6. 🔴 Table: Students Failing Most Subjects
7. 📈 Line Chart: Subject Performance by Grade
8. 📊 Bar Chart: Average Score by Subject
9. 📉 Line Chart: Percentage Distribution
10. 🎛️ Slicers: Student Name, Grade, Subject

------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 KEY INSIGHTS:

- Top 5 performers and their grades identified
- 13 students failed (based on subject-level score < 35)
- Subject with highest average: English
- Subject with lowest average: History
- Grade distribution shows majority scored B+ and above
- Pass percentage is visually represented via donut chart

------------------------------------------------------------

✅ CONCLUSION:
This Power BI dashboard helped visualize student performance effectively. It provided deep insights into both class-level and individual-level data and can be extended for semester-wise or year-wise analysis.
